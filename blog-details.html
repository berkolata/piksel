            is an open-source library of UI components built with the
            utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes

            Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some

            committing to an actual design project.
          </p>
          <p>
            It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons,
            navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are
            conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

          <p>
            First of all you need to understand how works. This library is not
            another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on
            Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive
            components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you can
            optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can check out the to explore the elements by including the CDN
            files into your project. But if you want to build a project with I
            recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can purge
            and minify the generated CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI,

            When does design come in handy?
          </h2>
          <p>
            While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some
            key moments in which prototyping will come in handy:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to
              exit out of screens? Can they follow your intended user journey
              and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
              usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with
              your design once it’s live;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your
              GDPR consent boxes are displaying properly? Pass your prototype to
              your data protection team and they can test it for real;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain
              or even sell your idea by providing your client with a hands-on
              experience;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an
              interactive medium to preview and test design elements, designers
              and developers can understand each other — and the project —
              better.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
          <p>
            Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
            ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before
            committing to an actual design project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's start by including the CSS file inside the
            <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.

          <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
          <h4>Type properties</h4>
          <p>
            A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique,
            certain shapes are shared across letters. A typeface represents
            shared patterns across a collection of letters.

          <h3>Type classification</h3>
          <h4>Serif</h4>
          <p>
            A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning
            or end of a stroke on a letter. Typefaces with serifs are called
            serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the following:
          </p>
          <h4>Old-Style serifs</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
            <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
            <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
          </ul>

          <ol>
            <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
            <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
            <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Laying the best for successful prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the
            beginning:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              is just awesome. It contains tons of predesigned components and
              pages starting from login screen to complex dashboard. Perfect
              choice for your next SaaS application.
            </p>

          <h4>Code example</h4>

          <h3>Best practices for setting up your prototype</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to
            how close a prototype will be to the real deal. If you’re simply
            preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity
            prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic
            text — would be more than enough. But if you’re going for more
            intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with
            on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user
            flow, try to think as your user would when interacting with your
            product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing,
            considering your user’s needs and habits early on will save you time
            by setting you on the right path.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both
            organize your tasks and create more user-friendly prototypes is by
            building your prototypes ‘inside out’. Start by focusing on what
            will be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image
            gallery, and list each element by order of priority. This way,
            you’ll be able to create a prototype that puts your users’ needs at
            the heart of your design.
          </p>
          <p>
            And there you have it! Everything you need to design and share
            prototypes — right in Figma.
